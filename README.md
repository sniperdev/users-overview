# Users overview

Users overview is a simple Angular application that allows users to view, add, edit, and delete users. The application uses Angular Materials for the UI and communicates with a RandomAPI to store and retrieve users data.


## Features

#### List of users
Upon opening the application, the current users list is presented.
#### Add user
1. Click "Add single" or "Add multiple".
2. Add all the information required to retrieve a user.
#### User details
Detailed user information can be viewed by clicking on a right blue button.
#### Delete user and Edit user

Additionally I used pagination to display users in a more user-friendly way and rxjs to handle the data flow.
